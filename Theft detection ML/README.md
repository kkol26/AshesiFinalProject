## ML model for Theft detection

The code was adapted from the GitHub repository - https://github.com/Om-Prakash08/Electricity-fraud-detection-using-CNN
Difference is in the method used to remove outliers in the data, hence different final results achieved
It also used data from the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC)
