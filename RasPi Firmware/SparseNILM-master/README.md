# Sparse NILM
Copyright (c) 2015 by Stephen Makonin

The super-state hidden Markov model disaggregator that uses a sparse Viterbi algorithm for decoding. This project contains the source code that was use for [IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid](http://makonin.com/doc/TSG_2015.pdf) journal paper.

**NOTE:** This code it a rewritten and modified version of the code used in Stephen Makonin PhD thesis.


**NOTE:** The main_NILM.py is a modified version of the test_bySteps.py. It has been modified to take input from the serial port of the raspberry Pi. The main_NILM.py is the code to be run on the Raspberry Pi 4 for Non-intrusive load monitoring in near real time.
